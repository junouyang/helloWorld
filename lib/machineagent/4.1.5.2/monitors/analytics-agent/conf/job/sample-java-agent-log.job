# If provided, then it means the file being tailed has records that span
# multiple lines.
#
# If not provided then it means that each line read from the file is to
# be treated as a separate record.
#
# To identify the beginning of a record, there are 2 options:
#   1) "startsWith" followed by the first few characters of a line that
#      indicate the beginning of a record.
#   2) "regex" followed by the regular expression that indicates the
#      beginning of a record.
#

# Optional property (Except "sourceType").
#
# These fields are in addition to the data that is already present in the
# files being tailed. Each record read from the file will be enriched with
# these fields.

#
# Grok is a way to define and use complex, nested regular expressions in an
# easy to read and use format.
#
# A Grok pattern ultimately resolves and compiles into a regular expression.
# The advantage of using Grok is its ability to compose complex patterns from
# simpler pattern definitions, like a "formal grammar".
#
# See https://grokdebug.herokuapp.com/patterns for examples.
#
# The application comes pre-loaded with some well known Grok patterns in
# the form of ".grok" files. They are available under the "conf/grok" directory.
# Custom Grok files can be added to this directory and they will be
# available for use here when the application is restarted.
#
# The Grok patterns here are meant to match a part of the log "message" string.
# If multiple Grok patterns are provided, each one will be applied to the
# "message" string individually.
#
# A Grok pattern is really a regular expression with the option of referencing
# other known Grok patterns by name. Like this "%{JAVACLASS:myClassName}".
# This means that we are looking for a sub-string that looks like a Java Class
# name. Once the pattern is found, the matching sub-string will be extracted
# and stored separately as a first class field, with "myClassName" as the key.
#
# By default, these patterns do not match multiline strings. To look for
# the pattern sub-string across a multiline string, please refer to:
# http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#DOTALL
#
# The 'eventTimestamp' here is a regular Java named capture group and the pattern
# here demonstrates that both Grok patterns and Regex patterns can co-exist. The
# 'eventTimestamp' field that is extracted by this Grok section will get picked
# up and transformed into a real DateTime object by the last "eventTimestamp"
# section.
#
grok:
   patterns:
     - "\\[%{DATA:threadName}\\] (?<eventTimestamp>%{MONTHDAY} %{MONTH} %{YEAR} %{HOUR}:%{MINUTE}:%{SECOND},%{POSINT})%{SPACE}%{LOGLEVEL:loglevel} %{JAVACLASS:class} \\- %{GREEDYDATA:logMessage}"

# Optional property.
#
# If records have a timestamp that should be used as "the" eventTimestamp then
# the format can be provided here to ensure that the string gets parsed and
# transformed correctly to UTC time zone.
#
# An attempt will be made to extract the timestamp automatically, failing which
# one will be added at the time the record is read from the file.
#
# UTC time zone is used throughout the system to ensure consistency of
# timestamps across sources from different time zones. This means that all
# timestamps should be converted to UTC time zone.
#
# If the format ends with a "z" or "Z" then the time zone offset is used to
# convert to UTC time. No time zone means local time zone.
