    # processSelectorRegex contains a regular expression that selects which
    # processes should be monitored by the machine agent. The regular expression is

    # When assigning processes to a class, it will be done in the following order:
    # Step #1: the processClassSelectorRegexList is applied if it contains any selectors.
    # Step #2: the defaultProcessClassSelector regular expression, if it is defined,
    #          will extract the process class if it hasn't been done in Step #1.
    # Step #3: If #1 and #2 find nothing, standard classification will be used which is
    #          to use the processName (shortened if needed).

    # To test the effect of any of the above or custom regular expressions, use a
    # command such as: ps -eww -o args | awk -v regex="$REGEX" '$0 ~ regex'

    # processClassSelectorRegexList contains an optional set of class selectors
    # that specify what processes are to be assigned to a defined class name.
    # Each entry specifies a class name and a regular expression.  The regular
    # expression is compared against the full command line.  If there are multiple
    # matching regex, then the first one in the list is used. Any process that
    # matches the expression is assigned to the given process class name.  An
    # example of how to specify the processClassSelectorRegexList is given below.

    # which should be selected for monitoring in case there are more classes

    # found in the command line, it will extract the first group occurrence of the

    # not find a match, normal selection is performed.
